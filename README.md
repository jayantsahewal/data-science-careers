# Introduction
Developed a webpage using HTML and CSS which describes some of the careers that you can pursue when you complete your data science degree. You can view the page [here](https://jayantsahewal.github.io/data-science-careers/)

# Design choices
* I used only 3 - 4 colors (sometimes using them for the foreground and sometimes using the same color for the background to keep the focus on the content while keeping the page aesthetically pleasing.
* I picked the background color from the image which helps in keeping the number of distinct colors to minimum.
* URLs change color and become underlined when mouse pointer hovers over them.

# References
* For the description of job titles, I relied heavily upon http://www.mastersindatascience.org which does a commendable job in differentiating the roles and responsibilities for each.
* I took the image from http://www.datasciencesociety.net/blog/latest/.
