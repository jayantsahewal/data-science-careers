  </div>

  <div class="introduction">
    <p>Data science is the study of where information comes from, what it represents and how it can be turned into a valuable resource in the creation of business and IT strategies. Mining large amounts of structured and unstructured data to identify patterns can help an organization rein in costs, increase efficiencies, recognize new market opportunities and increase the organization's competitive advantage.</p>
    <p>A McKinsey report estimates that by 2018, the United States could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 data scientists and 1.5 million managers and analysts who understand how to use big data to make decisions. So, it makes sense to pursue such demanding field. There are multiple ways to pursue data science stream. One of the most popular ways is to earn a master's degree in Data Science.</p>
    <p>A master's degree in Data Science program will help you learn how to explore data using high-level mathematics, statistics, and computer science, how to analyze data, visualize results, and articulate the subsequent discoveries. Many of the universities offer these degrees online as well because a number of professionals want to continue with their jobs while pursuing such offerings.</p>
    <p>Once you complete your master's degree, you will look for potential career options. There are a number of roles/job titles you will find. Depending upon the company, these can be very similar or very different in nature. At the core of each of these roles, you will deal with variety of datasets and try to extract meaningful information from them. Here are top 5 roles/job titles within the industry in the United States.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data Scientist</li>
      <li>Data Architect</li>
      <li>Data Engineer</li>
      <li>Business Analyst</li>
      <li>Data Analyst</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following table lists the number of job openings (posted on LinkedIn) and the current average salary for the above job titles (reported by Glassdoor) in the U.S.</p>
    <table class="role-comparison-table">

          <td>$60,476</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>It is evident that Data Scientists tend to earn more on an average even though the number of jobs is more for Business Analysts. Now, we will look at a brief description of these roles and links to relevant jobs on LinkedIn, Glassdoor and Indeed.</p>

      <h2 class="role-name">Data Scientist</h2>
      <p class="role-description">Data scientists are big data wranglers. They take an enormous mass of messy data points (unstructured and structured) and use their formidable skills in math, statistics and programming to clean, massage and organize them. Then they apply all their analytic powers - industry knowledge, contextual understanding, skepticism of existing assumptions - to uncover hidden solutions to business challenges. Every company will have a different take on job tasks. Some treat their data scientists as glorified data analysts or combine their duties with data engineers; others need top-level analytics experts skilled in intense machine learning and data visualizations.</p>

      <h2 class="role-name">Data Architect</h2>
      <p class="role-description">Data architects create blueprints for data management systems. After assessing a company's potential data sources (internal and external), architects design a plan to integrate, centralize, protect and maintain them. This allows employees to access critical information in the right place, at the right time. Some companies need data architects who are ninjas in data modeling techniques; others want experts in data warehousing, ETL tools, SQL databases or data administration. Most data architects are senior-level employees with plenty of years in business intelligence under their belts.</p>

      <h2 class="role-name">Data Engineer</h2>
      <p class="role-description">Data engineers build massive reservoirs for big data. They develop, construct, test and maintain architectures such as databases and large-scale data processing systems. Once continuous pipelines are installed to - and from - these huge "pools" of filtered information, data scientists can pull relevant data sets for their analyses. Data engineers may work closely with data architects (to determine what data management systems are appropriate) and data scientists (to determine which data are needed for analysis). They often wrestle with problems associated with database integration and messy, unstructured data sets. Their ultimate aim is to provide clean, usable data to whomever may require it.</p>

      <h2 class="role-name">Business Analyst</h2>
      <p class="role-description">A Business Analyst is someone who analyzes the existing or ideal organization and design of systems, including businesses, departments, and organizations. Business Analysts also assess business models and their integration with technology. Business analysts have varying degrees of technical know-how. Some tackle each job by employing their know-how in business administration, finance or management. Others come at the problem with extensive knowledge of IT processes.</p>

      <h2 class="role-name">Data Analyst</h2>
      <p class="role-description">Data analysts collect, process and perform statistical analyses of data. Their skills may not be as advanced as data scientists (e.g. they may not be able to create new algorithms), but their goals are the same - to discover how data can be used to answer questions and solve problems. Data analysts are sometimes called "junior data scientists" or "data scientists in training". Instead of being free to create their own big data projects, they may be limited to tackling specific business tasks using existing tools, systems and data sets.</p>
